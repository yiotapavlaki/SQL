# SQL
This repository showcases my SQL work completed during the Data Technician programme.
Across multiple real‑world scenarios, I used MySQL Workbench to query relational databases, analyse business data, and extract insights for marketing, logistics, sales, and global research teams.
This work demonstrates strong foundations in SQL querying, joins, aggregation, and relational database design.

🧠 **Skills Demonstrated**
- Relational database concepts (keys, relationships, joins)
- Filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregating data
- INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, and SELF joins
- Working with the Northwind and World databases
- Business‑driven data analysis
- Using MySQL Workbench to run and validate queries

📘 *Northwind Analysis*
Completed tasks involving:
- Customer, product, and order analysis
- Marketing and logistics filtering
- Category and inventory insights
- Supplier, product, and order relationships
- Aggregations for business reporting


🌍 *World Database Analysis*
Completed tasks involving:
- City and country demographics
- Population filtering and ranking
- Life expectancy and density insights
- Capital city identification
- Regional and alphabetical sorting
- Average population calculations
